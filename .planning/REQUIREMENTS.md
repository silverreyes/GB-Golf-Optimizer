# Requirements: GB Golf Optimizer

**Defined:** 2026-03-13
**Core Value:** Generate the best possible cash contest lineups from the user's available player cards, maximizing expected score within salary and collection constraints.

## v1 Requirements

### Upload

- [x] **UPLD-01**: User can upload a GameBlazers roster CSV export (columns: Player, Positions, Team, Multiplier, Overall, Franchise, Rookie, Tradeable, Salary, Collection, Status, Expires)
- [x] **UPLD-02**: User can upload a weekly projections CSV containing player name and projected fantasy score

### Optimization

- [x] **OPT-01**: Optimizer generates 3 optimal lineups for The Tips contest (6 golfers per lineup, salary $30,000–$64,000, max 3 Weekly Collection cards, max 6 Core cards)
- [x] **OPT-02**: Optimizer generates 2 optimal lineups for The Intermediate Tee contest (5 golfers per lineup, salary $20,000–$52,000, max 2 Weekly Collection cards, max 5 Core cards)
- [x] **OPT-03**: Cash contest (The Tips) is fully optimized first; Intermediate Tee lineups are built using only cards not already assigned to Tips lineups
- [x] **OPT-04**: Each card may appear in at most one lineup across all contests (cards are locked per lineup)
- [x] **OPT-05**: Effective card value is calculated as projected_score × multiplier
- [x] **OPT-06**: Optimizer respects both the salary floor (minimum) and salary cap (maximum) for each contest
- [x] **OPT-07**: Contest parameters (salary cap, salary floor, roster size, max entries, collection limits) are stored in an editable JSON config file

### Data Integrity

- [x] **DATA-01**: Cards with $0 salary are automatically excluded from optimization (not in tournament field)
- [x] **DATA-02**: App surfaces a report of roster players with no matching projection so the user can identify data gaps
- [x] **DATA-03**: Cards past their Expires date are automatically excluded from optimization

### Display

- [ ] **DISP-01**: User can view all generated lineups in the browser, showing for each lineup: player name, collection, salary, multiplier, projected score, and lineup totals (total salary, total projected score)
- [ ] **DISP-02**: Lineups are clearly grouped by contest (The Tips vs The Intermediate Tee)

### Deployment

- [ ] **DEPL-01**: App is deployed and accessible via the Hostinger KVM 2 VPS (silverreyes.net or subdomain)

## v2 Requirements

### Usability

- **USBL-01**: Contest configuration editor in the web UI (currently requires direct JSON file edit)
- **USBL-02**: Card comparison view — side-by-side display of multiple cards for the same player
- **USBL-03**: Manual lock/exclude — user can force a specific card in or out before optimizing
- **USBL-04**: Lineup export — copy lineup to clipboard or download as CSV for easy entry into GameBlazers

### Advanced Optimization

- **ADV-01**: Exposure limits — cap how often a single golfer appears across all lineups (e.g. max 2 of 5 lineups)
- **ADV-02**: Diversity constraints — enforce minimum player differences between lineups beyond card locking
- **ADV-03**: Sensitivity analysis — show how lineup changes if a player's projection shifts

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Scraping GameBlazers for contest data | Fragile, login-dependent; manual config file is simpler and reliable |
| Automatic projection fetching | User averages multiple sources manually; automation adds complexity without clear benefit |
| User accounts / authentication | Single shared app; no per-user data to protect |
| RUC (Recycling Useless Cards) optimization | Separate system; out of scope for lineup optimizer |
| Mobile native app | Web app accessible from any browser |
| Stacking constraints | Team-sport DFS concept; irrelevant for individual-sport golf |
| Overall score in optimization | GameBlazers "Overall" is for RUC card burning only, not performance prediction |
