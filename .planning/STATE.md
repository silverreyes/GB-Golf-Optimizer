# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-13)

**Core value:** Generate the best possible cash contest lineups from the user's available player cards, maximizing expected score within salary and collection constraints.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Data Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 3 (Data Foundation) — COMPLETE
Plan: 4 of 4 in current phase (all plans complete)
Status: Phase 1 complete — ready for Phase 2 (Optimizer)
Last activity: 2026-03-13 -- Completed 01-04 (pipeline integration + CLI)

Progress: [███░░░░░░░] 33%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 3-phase structure derived from dependency chain (data -> optimizer -> UI/deploy)
- [Roadmap]: OPT-05 (effective value calc) and OPT-07 (contest config) assigned to Phase 1 since they are data-layer concerns consumed by the optimizer
- [Phase 01-data-foundation]: Used setuptools.build_meta (not backends.legacy:build) for Python 3.11/pip 24 compat
- [Phase 01-data-foundation]: Lazy imports inside test functions ensure pytest collection succeeds with 0 errors (RED at execution, not collection)
- [Phase 01-data-foundation]: parse_roster_csv validates required columns immediately on open — fails fast with sorted missing column list
- [Phase 01-data-foundation]: effective_value = round(projected_score * multiplier, 4) to avoid float precision noise
- [Phase 01-data-foundation]: dateutil fallback for Expires treats unparseable as None (card included) — safer than accidental exclusion
- [Phase 01-data-foundation]: Pydantic-at-boundary: validate external JSON with Pydantic, return plain ContestConfig dataclass — avoids Pydantic coupling in optimizer
- [Phase 01-data-foundation]: Filter order: salary==0 first, then expired card, then no projection — first match wins, one ExclusionRecord per card
- [Phase 01-data-foundation P04]: Pool-size guard in validate_pipeline() uses min(c.roster_size for c in contests) — fails fast before optimizer receives unusable data
- [Phase 01-data-foundation P04]: format_* functions return strings (not print) — __main__.py controls all I/O, keeps formatters pure/testable
- [Phase 01-data-foundation P04]: total_parsed = valid + excluded — projection_warnings are data quality notes (skipped CSV rows), not missing cards

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Franchise/Rookie CSV columns: unclear whether these are separate collection types requiring ILP constraints or boolean flags. Must verify against a real GameBlazers export before Phase 2.
- Same-golfer-in-same-lineup rule: confirm whether GameBlazers allows the same golfer on two different cards in one lineup. Affects Phase 2 ILP formulation.
