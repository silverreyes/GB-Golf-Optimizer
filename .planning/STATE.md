# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-25)

**Core value:** Generate the best possible cash contest lineups from the user's available player cards, maximizing expected score within salary and collection constraints.
**Current focus:** v1.2 Automated Projection Fetching — Phase 8 complete, Phase 9 next

## Current Position

Phase: 8 of 11 (Database Foundation) — first phase of v1.2
Plan: 1 of 1 (Complete)
Status: Phase 8 complete
Last activity: 2026-03-25 — Phase 8 Plan 1 (Database Foundation) complete

Progress: [##########] 100% (1/1 plans done)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All key decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

Recent decisions affecting current work:
- Database: PostgreSQL via Flask-SQLAlchemy (Core queries, no ORM) with Flask-Migrate for schema migrations
- HTTP client: httpx for DataGolf API calls (timeout as first-class param, no C deps)
- Scheduler: system cron invoking `flask fetch-projections` CLI command (no APScheduler/Celery)
- Secrets: `.env` file with python-dotenv (DATABASE_URL + DATAGOLF_API_KEY)
- Name normalization: `parse_datagolf_name()` for "Last, First" -> "First Last" + existing `normalize_name()` NFKD pipeline
- Phase 8: SQLite in-memory fallback when DATABASE_URL not set (avoids KeyError in test/dev)
- Phase 8: pool_pre_ping=True for Gunicorn forked worker safety
- Phase 8: ON DELETE CASCADE at database level for fetches->projections FK

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- DataGolf API response field names unconfirmed — requires live discovery call at Phase 9 start
- DataGolf Scratch Plus API key needed before Phase 9 execution
